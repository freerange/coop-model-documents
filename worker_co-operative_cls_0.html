        control, the Co-operative shall ensure that, in addition to the
        annual general meeting, at least four other general meetings are
        held annually. The purpose of these meetings is to ensure that
        Members are given the opportunity to participate in the
        decision-making process of the Co-operative, review the business
        planning and management processes and to ensure the Co-operative
        manages itself in accordance with the co-operative values and

      <h2>Notices</h2>

      <li>
        The Directors shall call the annual general meeting giving 14

        proposed resolutions. The notice must also contain a statement
        setting out the right of each Member to appoint a proxy.
      </li>

      <li>
        The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting to or
        non-receipt of notice of a meeting by any person entitled to
        receive notice shall not invalidate proceedings at that meeting.
      </li>

      <h2>Proxies</h2>

      <li>
        A Member who is absent from a general meeting may appoint any
        Person to act as their proxy, provided that no Person shall hold a
        proxy for more than five Members at any one time in any general
        meeting.
      </li>

      <li>
        Proxies may only validly be appointed by a notice in Writing
        which:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            States the name and Address of the Member appointing the proxy;
          </li>

            appointed;
          </li>

          <li>
            Is signed by or on behalf of the Member appointing the proxy,
            or is authenticated in such manner as the Directors may

            Articles and any instructions contained in the notice of the
            general meeting to which they relate.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        The Co-operative may require proxy notices to be delivered in a
        particular form and may specify different forms for different
        purposes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Proxy notices may specify how the proxy appointed under them is to
        vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more
        of the resolutions, otherwise the proxy notice shall be treated as
        allowing the Person appointed the discretion as how to vote on any
        matter.
      </li>

      <li>
        A person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a
        show of hands or a poll) at a general meeting remains so entitled
        in respect of that meeting or any adjournment of the general
        meeting to which it relates.
      </li>

      <li>
        An appointment using a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering
        to the Co-operative a notice in Writing given by or on behalf of
        the Person by whom or on whose behalf the proxy notice was
        given. A notice revoking a proxy appointment only takes effect if
        it is delivered before the start of the meeting or the adjourned
        meeting to which it relates.
      </li>

      <li>
        If a proxy notice is not signed by the Person appointing the
        proxy, it must be accompanied by evidence in Writing that the
        person signing it has the authority to execute it on the
        appointor’s behalf.

        at the time any meeting proceeds to business then the Members
        present shall choose one of their number to be the chairperson for
        that meeting. The appointment of a chairperson shall be the first
        item of business at the general meeting.
      </li>

      <h2>Attendance and Speaking at General Meetings</h2>

      <li>
        A Member is able to exercise the right to speak at a general
        meeting and is deemed to be in attendance when that Person is in a
        position to communicate to all those attending the meeting. The
        Directors may make whatever arrangements they consider appropriate
        to enable those attending a general meeting to exercise their
        rights to speak or vote at it including by Electronic Means. In
        determining attendance at a general meeting, it is immaterial
        whether any two or more Members attending are in the same place as
        each other.
      </li>

      <li>
        The chairperson of the meeting may permit other persons who are

        meetings, without granting any voting rights.
      </li>

      <h2>Adjournment</h2>

      <li>
        If a quorum is not present within half an hour of the time the
        general meeting was due to commence, or if during a meeting a
        quorum ceases to be present, the chairperson must adjourn the
        meeting. If within half an hour of the time the adjourned meeting
        was due to commence a quorum is not present, the Members present
        shall constitute a quorum.
      </li>

      <li>
        The chairperson of a general meeting may adjourn the meeting
        whilst a quorum is present if:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            The meeting consents to that adjournment; or
          </li>

          <li>
            It appears to the chairperson that an adjournment is necessary
            to protect the safety of any persons attending the meeting or
            to ensure that the business of the meeting is conducted in an
            orderly manner.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        The chairperson must adjourn the meeting if directed to do so by
        the meeting.
      </li>

      <li>
        When adjourning a meeting the chairperson must specify the date,
        time and place to which it will stand adjourned or that the
        meeting is to continue at a date, time and place to be fixed by
        the Directors.
      </li>

      <li>
        If the meeting is adjourned for 14 days or more, at least 7 clear
        days’ notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given in the same
        manner as the notice of the original meeting.
      </li>

      <li>
        No business shall be transacted at an adjourned meeting other than
        business which could not properly have been transacted at the
        meeting if the adjournment had not taken place.
      </li>

      <h2>Voting</h2>

      <li>
        In accordance with the Co-operative Principle of democratic member
        control, each Member shall have one vote on any question to be
        decided in general meeting. This article is Entrenched in
        accordance with section 22 of the Act; any alteration to this
        article requires the approval of 100% of the Members.
      </li>

      <li>
        A resolution put to the vote at a general meeting shall be decided
        on a show of hands unless a poll is duly demanded in accordance
        with these Articles.
      </li>

      <li>
        In the case of an equality of votes, whether on a show of hands or
        a poll, the chairperson shall not have a second or casting vote
        and the resolution shall be deemed to have been lost.
      </li>

      <h2>Poll Votes</h2>

      <li>
        A poll on a resolution may be demanded:
        <ol type="a">

            to the vote; or
          </li>

          <li>
            At a general meeting, either before a show of hands on that
            resolution or immediately after the result of a show of hands on
            that resolution is declared.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>

        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        A demand for a poll may be withdrawn if the poll has not yet been
        taken and the chairperson consents to the withdrawal.
      </li>

        such terms and conditions as they think fit.

      </li>

      <li>
        A Director is able to exercise the right to speak at a meeting of
        the Board of Directors and is deemed to be in attendance when that
        person is in a position to communicate to all those attending the

        consider appropriate to enable those attending a meeting of the
        Board of Directors to exercise their rights to speak or vote at it
        including by Electronic Means. In determining attendance at a a
        meeting of the Board of Directors, it is immaterial whether any
        two or more Directors attending are in the same place as each
        other.
      </li>

      <li>
        Questions arising at any meetings shall be decided by a majority
        of votes. In the case of an equality of votes the status quo shall

        matter to a general meeting of the Co-operative.
      </li>

      <li>
        A written resolution, circulated to all Directors and signed by a
        simple majority (51%) of Directors, shall be valid and effective
        as if it had been passed at a Board meeting duly convened and
        held. A written resolution may consist of several identical
        Documents signed by one or more Directors.
      </li>

      <li>
        The Board of Directors may, at its discretion, invite other
        persons to attend its meetings with or without speaking rights and
        without voting rights. Such attendees will not count toward the
        quorum.
      </li>

      <li>
        The Directors must ensure that the Co-operative keeps a record, in
        Writing, for at least 10 years from the date of the decision
        recorded, of every unanimous or majority decision taken by the
        Directors.
      </li>

      <h2>Quorum</h2>

      <li>
        The quorum necessary for the transaction of business at a meeting
        of the Board of Directors shall be 50% of the Directors or 2,
        whichever is the greater.
      </li>

      <li>
        If at any time the total number of Directors in office is less
        than the quorum required, the Directors must not take any
        decisions other than to appoint further Directors or to call a
        general meeting so as to enable the Members to appoint further
        Directors.
      </li>

      <h2>Chairperson</h2>

      <li>
        Directors shall appoint one of their number as the chairperson to
        facilitate meetings of the Board of Directors. If s/he is absent
        or unwilling to act at the time any meeting proceeds to business
        then the Directors present shall choose one of their number to be
        the chairperson for that meeting. The appointment of a chairperson
        shall be the first item of business at the meeting.
      </li>

      <h2>Declaration of Interest</h2>

      <li>
        Whenever a Director has a personal, financial or material
        interest, whether directly or indirectly, in a matter to be
        discussed at a meeting and whenever a Director has an interest in
        another unincorporated body, firm, partnership or corporate body
        whose interests are reasonably likely to conflict with those of
        the Co-operative in relation to a matter to be discussed at a
        meeting, notwithstanding matters relating to the terms of business
        of the Co-operative, s/he must;
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            Declare the nature and extent of the interest before the
            discussion begins on the matter;
          </li>

          <li>
            Withdraw from that part of the meeting unless expressly

            Withdraw during the vote and have no vote on the matter.
          </li>
        </ol>

        Provided that nothing in this Article shall prevent a Director
        from counting towards the quorum for Board meetings and voting
        where the matter relates to her/his own contract of employment or
        in respect of her/his rights and interests as a Member or Equity
        Shareholder.
      </li>

      <li>
        Subject to anything to the contrary in these Articles:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>
            In accordance with (but subject to) the Companies Acts, the
            Board of Directors may give authorisation in respect of a
            situation in which a Director has, or could have, a direct or
            indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict,
            with the interests of the Co-operative; and
          </li>

          <li>
            In authorising a situation the Board of Directors may decide,
            whether at the time of giving the authorisation or
            subsequently, that if the conflicted Director has obtained any
            information through her/his involvement in the situation
            otherwise that as a Director and in respect of which s/he owes
            a duty of confidentiality to another Person, the Director is
            under no obligation to:
            <ol type="i">
              <li>
                Disclose that information to the Co-operative; and/or
              </li>

              <li>
                Use that information for the benefit of the Co-operative;
              </li>
            </ol>
            where to do so would amount to a breach of confidence.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <h2>Expenses</h2>

      <li>
        The Co-operative may pay any reasonable expenses which the
        Directors properly incur in connection with their attendance at
        meetings or otherwise in connection with the exercise of their
        powers and the discharge of their responsibilities in relation to
        the Co-operative.
      </li>

      <h2>Termination of a Director’s Appointment</h2>

      <li>
        A person ceases to be a Director of the Co-operative as soon as:
        <ol type="a">

          <li>
            That person ceases to be a Member of the Co-operative (unless
            they are a co-opted independent external Director);
          </li>

          <li>
            That person resigns from office in Writing to the Secretary of

            by law;
          </li>

          <li>
            A bankruptcy order is made against that person;

          </li>

          <li>
            By reason of that person’s mental health, a court makes an

          <li>
            In accordance with the Co-operative Principle of member
            economic participation, to a dividend for Members, either

        shall be transferred to some other organisation(s) whose purpose
        is to promote and support the Co-operative Movement and common
        ownership enterprises. This article is Entrenched in accordance

        winding up of the Co-operative, or according to some other
        equitable formula agreed by the Members on winding up which
        complies with the Co-operative Principles. If such residual
        assets cannot be distributed in this manner they shall be
        transferred to a common ownership co-operative (s) or to
        Co-operatives UK (or any body that succeeds to its function).
