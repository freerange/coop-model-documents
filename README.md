This repository contains a clean HTML translation of
the
[Model governing document](https://www.uk.coop/developing-co-ops/model-governing-documents) for
a
[Worker Coâ€‘operative Company Limited by Shares](https://www.uk.coop/developing-co-ops/model-governing-documents/worker-co-operative-company-limited-shares) provided
by [Co-operatives UK](https://www.uk.coop).

The model documents provided by Co-operatives UK are in PDF format
which makes it difficult to keep track of the changes an individual
co-operative makes when adopting them.

The original PDF as downloaded from Co-operatives UK is included in
this repository for completeness - but you should check that it is
current before use.

## Provenance

I downloaded
the
[PDF model document](https://www.uk.coop/sites/default/files/uploads/attachments/worker_co-operative_cls_0.pdf) for
a "Worker Co-operative Company Limited by Shares" from the
Co-operatives UK website on 2017-05-19. This document doesn't seem to
have any version metadata associated with it. The dates attached to
the PDF (visible in General Info in Preview on OS X) are:

- Creation date: 20 Jan 2012, 15:47
- Modification date: 29 May 2012, 10:31

A somewhat-usable HTML conversion of the PDF was generated by

1. `brew install qpdf`
2. `brew cask install adobe-acrobat-pro`
3. Strip the copy-protection from the supplied file using `qpdf
--decrypt worker_co-operative_cls_0.pdf
worker_co-operative_cls_0_decrypted.pdf`
4. Open Adobe Acrobat Pro, jump through the registration hoops to get
a 30 day trial. Export the decrypted PDF to HTML

The HTML was then edited by hand to clean it up. I verified that the
automatic numbering in the rendered HTML matched the paragraph
numbering in the original.
